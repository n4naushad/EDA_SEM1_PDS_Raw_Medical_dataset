EDA Project (SEM1): Raw Medical Data Analysis
EDA Project: Raw Medical Data Analysis
Description:
This project uses Python to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a raw medical dataset. The analysis covers data import and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, advanced Python techniques, and deriving insights and conclusions. The project is documented and presented in a Jupyter Notebook.
Dataset Overview:
This dataset consists of medical-related data, including demographic and health-related information for a sample of individuals. The dataset contains 1,069 rows and 12 columns, with attributes such as:
●	Customer_id: Unique identifier for each individual
●	Timezone: Timezone of the individual
●	Job: Job title of the individual
●	Children: Number of children
●	Age: Age of the individual
●	Education: Highest level of education attained
●	VitD_levels: Vitamin D levels (ng/mL)
●	Soft_drink: Indicator of soft drink consumption (Yes/No)
●	Overweight: Indicator of overweight status (0: No, 1: Yes)
●	Population: Population of the area
●	Area: Type of area (Urban/Suburban/Rural)
●	Income: Annual income of the individual
Planned Steps for Analysis:
●	Data Import and Cleaning: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, Check the 'shape' and ‘Type” of the data, Check for missing values, handle them, remove duplicates, convert in the required format, and prepare them for analysis.
●	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics Summarising Numerical & Categorical columns. Analyzing patterns, distributions, and relationships in the data using visual and statistical methods.
●	Data Visualisation: For obtaining insights, Histograms for numerical columns, Bar Plot for Categorical, Box plots for outliers and spread of data, Scatter plots for relationships, and Heat maps for correlation between numerical features.
●	Group Analysis:  Based on categorical features.
●	Feature Analysis: From visualisation plots, features are learnt.
●	Pivot Tables : Data Summarisation using group by.
●	Advanced Python Techniques: Lambda Functions, user-defined functions, and applying more complex methods to derive deeper insights.
●	List of Comprehensions :
●	Insights and Conclusions: Drawing key insights from the analysis and summarising.
●	Planning next steps: Action Plans for mitigation and improvements from insights, to implement an overweight awareness campaign in the affected regions.
●	Documentation and Presentation: Organizing the findings for clear communication.
